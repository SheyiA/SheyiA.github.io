    <h2>Recent skills I learned during my journey at SAIT 
        are the listed images below and more. Although my 
        experience with some of the languages and frameworks 
        may be limited, my willingness to learn and expand my 
        knowledge are immense. I am really confident in HTML and 
        CSS which is something I enjoy a lot. I enjoy web development 
        a lot and have a true passion. C# and Java are two languages I 
        want to continue to learn more  and eventually become extremely 
        confident with since they are so powerful. All future projects 
        and current projects can be seen on my github which is linked on 
        my contact page for those interested and wanting to stay up to date 
        with current and future projects. There will be more updates done to 
        this page so stay tuned for further development </h2>
